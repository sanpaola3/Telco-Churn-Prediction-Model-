📉 Customer Churn Prediction – Telecom Industry
This project applies supervised machine learning to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The objective is to identify customers at risk of leaving the service and provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

🎯 Objective
Build a predictive model that classifies customers as:

Likely to churn

Not likely to churn
Based on behavioral patterns and contract-related features.

🧠 Methods & Approach
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Merging datasets

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Addressing class imbalance

🤖 Model Training & Evaluation

Split data into train/test sets

Compare models using relevant metrics

📌 Key Takeaways
Contract type, billing details, and tenure are strong indicators of customer churn.

Early intervention strategies can be tailored based on the predicted churn risk.

The model enables the business to focus efforts on high-risk customer segments, improving retention and ROI.
